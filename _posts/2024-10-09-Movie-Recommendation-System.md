This program allows the end user to input a movie they are interested in and view recommended movies similar to the user's movie choice. 
A movie recommendation system has concrete use cases, as multiple streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Max, etc) have seen major successes with their advanced recommender systems.
