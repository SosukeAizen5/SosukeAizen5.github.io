After hearing so many things on the news about the airline industry not being safe anymore, don't you wonder if it's really true? 
The infographic presented here unravels the data-backed truth concerning the safety ratings of the airline industry to those who may be in a rush, busy on their phones, or who are otherwise unable to provide their full attention for more than five minutes. 
With the media attacking the airline industry and putting out puzzling statistics, the infographic effectively captures and communicates real airline safety statistics from reputable sources in a consolidated banner that allows maximum provision of knowledge against minimal time. 
All audiences can benefit from the infographic's message so they know how the media is stirring up fear in their viewers with no real data to support their claims and how the airline industry has performed in the last few decades to keep you safe when traveling on an airplane. 
Stunning visualizations from Python and Microsoft PowerBI are incorporated to easily bequeath knowledge on the viewer and the explanation given in the presentation adequately states the other side of the coin the media conveniently leaves out.
