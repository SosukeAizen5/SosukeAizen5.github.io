This study utilizes predictive analytics to leverage Disneyland theme park review data from TripAdvisor. The reviews are subject to data preparation, textual preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and multiple machine learning algorithms. This research utilizes many data science skills to gather insight on trends found in the reviews, establish sentiment classes, output visualizations that identify the most important elements in the Disneyland theme park experience, and predict review text sentiment through classification models like logistic regression, Naive Bayes, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. 

Each portion of the study can be found below.
