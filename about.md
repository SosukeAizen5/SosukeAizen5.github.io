## About Me

Hi, I'm David Berberena! I am a chef looking to break into the data science world with Python programming knowledge, data mining and visualization skills, model creation and performance analysis techniques, and a desire to contribute to the world of data using my evolving skillset. My main focus areas include:

- Data Transformation (Pandas, NumPy, sci-kitlearn, dplyr)
- Data Visualization (Microsoft PowerBI, Matplotlib, ggplot2)
- Predictive Modeling (regression, time series, classification)
- Big Data technologies (Hadoop, Hive, Spark, Kafka)

My projects (past and present) represent my working knowledge of data science principles and my eagerness to create projects that are applicable to real-world business scenarios.
